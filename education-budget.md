# Education budget

Starting January 1, 2019, we are introducing a yearly education budget for each person. 
We want to be more transparent and we believe that having the coherent rules regarding extra learning opportunities will help.

### What is the amount of a yearly education budget?
The amount depends on the number of hours a person works per week. A full-time employee (40 hours per week on average) gets 4 000 PLN education budget. 

### What if I don't work full-time?

If you work less hours then your budget will be proportionally smaller e.g. a half-time (20 hours per week on average) employee gets 2 000 PLN. Similarly, the amount will be proportional to a number of months your work in a given year e.g. if you join HTD on July 1, 2019 then your education budget will be 2 000 PLN in 2019 and 4 000 PLN in 2020 and later.

### What if I work part-time (say 0.75 of full-time) until July 1 and then full-time?
We will use a rule of proportionality. In the aforementioned cases, the first half of the year will give you 1 500 PLN calculated as 0.75 * 2 000 PLN and the second part of the year will incur 2 000 PLN. In total your education budget for that year will be 3 500 PLN.

### Will the amount change in the future?
Our will is to significantly increase the education budget in the future. If the "education budget" initiative proves to be a sound idea then increasing the amount will be a priority as the company grows.

### Is everyone eligible for the education budget?
The education budget applies to all the employees, regardless of the type of contract. Therefore no matter whether you have a B2B contract, Umowa Zlecenie or Umowa o Pracę you have an education budget.

### How does the education budget affect my taxes?
The money you spent from your education budget will be taxed as your revenue so your tax base will be higher. The tax office (Urząd Skarbowy) will treat the amount spent as if you received extra cash revenue.

### What you can spend the money on
The budget can be spent both on software design and development related things including, but not limited to:
- books
- online courses, including online university courses like Coursera, edX etc.
- conferences including conference tickets, travel expenses (train and airline tickets, BlaBlaCar etc.), gas if travelling by car, hotel. Food/meals are excluded and should be paid for with you personal money.
- paid Meetups and events
- post-graduate studies
- onsite and online training, including trainings required to pass certain certification exams
- certification/exam fees e.g. Product Owner, Scrum Master, AWS and other certifications. AWS exams taken until February 1, 2019 will be paid from the company-wide budget and as such will not decrease your education budget.
- English lessons (more on this further down)

### What if I want to buy something that is not listed above?
If your expense is not listed above please ask [Maciek Z](https://github.com/maciej-zywno) We want to keep the rules quite relaxed and reasonable e.g. a book on psychology would still fall under the budget if it helps understand digital apps users behavior.

### How does the education budget affect our English lessons held in the office?
Starting January 1, English lessons will be paid from employees education budget. The 2019 rate of English conversation with our English teacher will be known in December, 2018. You are welcome to attend English course of your choice or take private conversations outside of the office and pay for it fully or partially out of your education budget. Please note that you will still need to provide an invoice.

### What kind of expenses are excluded?
- BSc and MSc programmes are excluded
- hardware. However, if you have an idea for a hardware, please reach out to [Maciek Z](https://github.com/maciej-zywno) and we will consider buying it from the company-wide budget.
- meals. You can however book a room with breakfast included and then effectively the breakfast meal will be paid from your education budget.

### Hotel, tickets, meals... it’s all too complicated. Please give me a real world example.

Imagine you buy a ticket to Meet.js conference in Poznań, go there with your own car and book a hotel room with breakfast included. While staying there you also buy a lunch at the conference venue and a dinner at the hotel.

Out of all the aforementioned expenses, the following ones can be paid out of your education budget:
- conference ticket 
- gas
- hotel room with breakfast included

### Will HTD still pay for shared online courses from the company budget?
Yes. HTD will continue paying for online courses that we consider basic and as such will be e.g. a part of our onboarding. 
If you think that a given online course would benefit a larger group of people please do reach out to [Maciek Z](https://github.com/maciej-zywno) and we will consider funding it from the company-wide budget.

### Will HTD still be buying physical books from the company budget?

Yes. If you think that a given book will benefit a larger group of people please add a comment to [HTD Bookshelf | Requests tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/160JGrusqDqLwSK20DL9AuPQ12yMkVujK_qfkER8Ay2k/edit#gid=1603685952), mention Maciek Z in your comment and we will consider funding it from the company-wide budget.


### I found a conference/book/whatever that I want to buy from my education budget. How will I pay for it?
Our will is to order Revolut physical prepaid business cards for all the employees and then hand it out to each employee in December 2018 and they will keep it at home. If we go that route then you will simply be able to use the card both online and at physical locations.
Please note that we are not yet sure if Revolut Business will work for us so we might go different route. 

### What if I want to attend a training that costs 4 500 + VAT? Can I use my budget for that?
Yes, you can. You can use whatever chunk of your budget to fund such a training e.g. you can take 2 000 PLN from your education budget and pay the rest (2 500) from your personal money.

### Is VAT tax included in the amount?
The budget is reduced by a net amount (i.e. without VAT tax) of your expense if you provide an expense VAT invoice to us and the invoice lists "HTD Polska sp. z o.o." as a buyer. If you are not able to provide such an invoice then your budget will be reduced by the brutto amount (i.e. including VAT).

For instance, if you pay 1230 PLN (1000 net + 230 PLN VAT) for a conference then if you provide an invoice then we treat it as the cost was 1000 PLN so your education budget is decreased by 1000 PLN. If you are not able to provide a VAT invoice with HTD Polska sp. z o.o. listed as a buyer then your education budget is decreased by 1230 PLN.

### How do I request an invoice from a seller e.g. from a conference organizer?
When you buy online you should fill a "Faktura VAT" form online on a seller website and put the following company data:

HTD Polska sp. z o.o.  
NIP 9471997285  
ul. Brukowa 12/18  
91-342 Łódź  

(Yes, put 91-342 as a zipcode) 

You should also be able to request an invoice by emailing a seller.  

### Who do I provide an invoice to?
Please upload an invoice to HTD Google Drive to an appropriate folder [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1R0ca_xUY-06EVTwHXCrkO2nwquzQhVzN). If you have a paper invoice then please scan it to pdf and then upload it. One of the apps you can use to scan documents into pdf format is Dropbox.


### What if I need to make a transfer?
If you need to make a transfer please contact with [Magda Z] on Slack.


### Should I report that I bought anything using my education budget?
Yes. Add an entry to ["Education budgets - expenses" Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WE352gD6To8EomFf-xK0UvMtNNw8hyXYUIZKOh4RPuM/edit#gid=0) as soon as you buy anything.

### Will I be paid for going to a conference or attending a training of my choice?
When you you go to a conference or a training of your choice we ask you to take an unpaid day(s) off i.e. unless instructed otherwise, do not log the time spent on a conference on any client or internal project. Specifically:
- do not log hours in Toggl
- request an unpaid day off in Calamari

### Should I notify a client about my absence?
You should proceed exactly the same as in case of taking any other paid or unpaid day off.

### I buy a conference ticket in December, 2020 and the conference takes place in January, 2021. What education budget year is used then?
The day when you pay is taken into account so in the listed case the money will be taken from your 2020 education budget.

### What happens if I don't spend my whole education budget until December 31?
No matter how much of your education budget is spent in a previous year, on January 1 you always start with 4 000 PLN.

### Can I use my education budget to buy an online course for my close friend?
No. The education budget can be used only for the things that are used personally by you e.g. you attending the conference, you reading the book, you attending the training, you watching the online course etc. 

If you do otherwise it will be a reason of terminating your contract immediately.

### Should I be reasonable when spending money from my education budget?
Please be reasonable and use the budget as if it was your own money. The education budget is simply a part of revenue that the whole team generates. In other words, the education budgets are our working time. Time is priceless.
