## Playbook

When reading this Playbook and talking to us you will often hear us referring to "warm fuzzy feeling" idea. You should have read this old [So you want to be a consultant...?](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html) article and been given [You must give the customer The Warm Fuzzy Feeling](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZgmWL8z5r3vQ8G0LZIT87Xz9YlJb9Yx2I0YJTr-rzgE/edit?usp=sharing) presentation as a part of your onboarding to fully understand what we mean by that. The central idea in the article is the following consulting maxim:

"You must give the customer The Warm Fuzzy Feeling". 

This playbook is meant to provide you with a number of ready to use recipes that will help you provide a warm fuzzy feelng to our clients. While we strive to include all the necessary information you might find yourself in situations when there is no clear recipe what to. Then, whenever in doubt, always ask yourself "Am I providing a warm fuzzy feeling to the client?"
